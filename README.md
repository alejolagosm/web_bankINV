# Landing page for a bank

This is a webpage for a digital investment bank. Uses only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
You can download the files and set up a local server, it should work just fine.

There are some cool properties and effects:

- Menu fade animation using the "bind" method to change opacity values depending on the events
- Sticky navigation using the intersection observer
- Modal pop-up window using JS to create an account.
- Smooth scrolling for buttons using the getboundingClient Rect() function and also the more modern ScrollIntoView() function.
- Smooth scrolling for page navigation using ScrollIntoView() function and event delegation.
- Lazy loading of images for better website performance.
- A tabbed component
- A slider component
